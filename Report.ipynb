      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>From the first graph \"School Data\" we can conclude that California has the most number of schools and the number of schools each year is growing steadily.</li>\n",
      "<li>The state with the highest cost of doing a 4 year program on an average is Wyoming and we also see that there is a steady decrease in the tuition fee with the years given.</li>\n",
      "<li>Undergraduate enrollments is maximum in California followed by Texas and New York and there was a steady increase till the year 2011 and then a slight fall in the count later. </li>\n",
      "<li>There is a drop in the faculty salary during the year 1998 and a steady increase later and the state where the faculty earns maximum is Rhode Island.</li>\n",
      "<li>We see that the state Federated States of Micronesia (FM) has the highest number of admission rate compared to other states. Which means that number of students who applied and the number of students who got an admit was high.</li>\n",
      "<li>From the next graph we see that the engineering and technology related passouts are gradually dropping from 0.03% in 1997 to 0.018 in 2013.</li>\n",
      "<li>Next is the graph based on number of students enrolled based on their income, we can see clearly that the number of students whose income is below 30,000$/Year have higher enrollment rates compared to others who are earning higher.\n",
